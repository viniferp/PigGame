🐷 Pig Game

Welcome to the Pig Game! This project showcases my knowledge in coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It brings the classic dice game to life, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unlike traditional versions, this game is designed for local multiplayer fun, allowing you to challenge your friend in an exciting race to reach 50 points. Roll the dice, strategize your moves, and may the luckiest player prevail!

🎮 Game Rules:

The game is played with a single six-sided die.
The players take turns rolling the die.
On each turn, a player can roll the die as many times as they want and accumulate points.
However, if a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all points accumulated in that turn. It's the other player's turn.
To save the points and end their turn voluntarily, a player can click the "Hold" button. The accumulated points are added to their total score.
The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins the game!
